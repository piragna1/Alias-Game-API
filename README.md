## Overview

Alias Game is a multiplayer word-guessing game currently under development.  
The goal of the project is to recreate the classic *Alias* experience in a digital environment, where players must describe a target word without using a set of forbidden words.  

The system includes:
- A backend service that builds and manages a word bank.  
- Automatic generation of forbidden words for each entry (semantic, phonetic, and spelling variations).
- An architecture designed for future expansion into multiplayer gameplay.  

This repository represents the foundation of the game logic, which will later integrate with a frontend interface to deliver a complete interactive experience.
